            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
                My goal is to display a personal project to close friends and colleagues to see. Therefore, my design needs to be professional 
                and clean, while retaining the colorful and fun tone of the game.

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>
                This personal project is still in development so this page will consist of the direction for the game.
                I initially used FlexBox for my spec but decided CSS Grid would be more
                benefical for this website's design. 
                I found it challenging to work with CSS grid however, I believe I've learned more about CSS grid 
                through this project. 
                Additionally, I changed the content that was on the original outline design.

        <div id="sources">
            <h3>Sources</h3>
            <p>
                Found the original design on pinterest. All images and text in the final design are provided by me.
                Font for spec and final design are from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Sono:wght@200..800">
                Google Fonts</a>
