            Hi! I'm Dania, a game design and development student at RIT. I'm working on this personal
            project that brings together my passion for animation and games. While I'm still
            exploring different game genres, I'm already shaping the visuals and tone inspired by
            the things I love. My influences include the charming world of the Kirby series and
            the creative styles of some of my favorite artists, like
            <a href="https://amelicart.com/">Amelicart</a> and
            <a href="https://www.emilyschofield.net/">Art with Em</a>.
            Stay tuned!
        </p>

                While working on this project, I've encountered some hurdles that have challenged my creative
                process. As I dive deeper into animation and game development, I'm focusing on overcoming
                these challenges to bring my vision to life. Here are some specific areas I'm currently
                navigating:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Collage/Crayon Style: I've found it difficult to replicate a collage or crayon-like
                    aesthetic digitally, so I'm developing my own custom brushes in Photoshop to
                    achieve those effects.
                </li>
                <li>Game Genre Exploration: I'm having a tough time settling on a specific game genre.
                    To ensure I make an informed choice, I'm keeping my options open and planning to
                    conduct thorough research on different genres.
                </li>
                <li>Story Development: I'm also working to finalize the general story behind the game,
                    as I want to ensure it aligns well with the overall tone and visuals I'm aiming for.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

                I'm excited to take on this project as a chance to expand my skills in Adobe Photoshop
                and Adobe Animate while exploring my artistic style. I'm also stepping out of my
                comfort zone by using Godot for the first time. Through this experience, I aim to
                refine my technical abilities, experiment with new tools, and push my creative boundaries.
                I'll also be developing my project management skills and embracing creative
                problem-solving along the way. I can't wait to see how this project helps me grow as
                both an artist and a developer!
